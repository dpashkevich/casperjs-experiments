# CasperJS Experiments

A set of experiments that attempt to use [CasperJS](http://casperjs.org/) to automate testing Web projects in various ways.

# Dependencies

You will need [CasperJS 1.1](http://casperjs.org/) as well as [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) (not tested with [SlimerJS](http://slimerjs.org/)).

# Running

Experiments are run from `src/` directory.

To run acceptance test:

    casperjs test acceptance.js --direct --log-level=info --url=example.com

To run action tests:

    casperjs test action-submitform.js [--screenshot-path=path/to/screenshots] --url=example.com/contacts
    casperjs test action-lightbox.js [--screenshot-path=path/to/screenshots] --url=example.com/gallery

To run responsive test:

    casperjs responsive.js [--screenshot-path=path/to/screenshots] example.com

There's a pre-defined `responsive.html` you can use to view the screenshots, currently it's not generated.
